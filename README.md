# token_mint

Mint your own Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens, for the cost of a few $SOL transactions.

Here is the breakdown:

95% of tokens  -> liquidity pool wallet

4.5% of tokens -> user of website

0.5% of tokens -> goes to the website

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user's public wallet address, showcasing the tokens they've created, with a 'like' button for each token.

The main page of the website will be a scrollable feed of the most popular tokens, sorted by most liked, filterable by Day, Week, Month, 6 Months, 1 Year, All Time.

The user will be able to decide how many tokens to mint (minMintedTokens == 10M && maxMintedTokens == 2B).

Arweave will be used to store and host the logo image (recommended 500x500px png, jpg, jpeg, or webp). You will also need to store a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that points to the image uri.
