# token_mint

A Solana token factory with no fees, just the transaction fees.

Here's the breakdown:

95% of tokens  -> liquidity pool wallet

4.5% of tokens -> user of website

0.5% of tokens -> goes to the website

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user, showcasing the logo art and name of the new token.

The user will be able to set a price for each token and auction off some of the premine, or they can just airdrop tokens as they see fit.

Starting a liquidity pool on Raydium is easy, but you probably want about $5k worth of capital to have a smooth launch.

Everything you need to start a cryptocurrency, and all you have to pay is the transaction fees, which are minimal on Solana.
