# MOONROCKET

Mint customizable Solana or Ethereum (using Arbitrum) tokens for just the price of the transaction fees (a few transactions on Solana / Arbitrum and Arweave). The transaction fees should be <$5 and probably around $1.

3% of tokens are sent to the MOONROCKET treasury vault as a fee and staked for 6 months.

97% of tokens are sent to your browser wallet extension (Solflare or MetaMask).
