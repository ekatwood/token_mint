# token_mint

A Solana token factory with no fees, just the transaction fees.

Here's the breakdown:

95% of tokens  -> liquidity pool wallet

4.5% of tokens -> user of website

0.5% of tokens -> goes to the website

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user's public wallet address, showcasing the tokens they've created, with a 'like' button for each.

The main page will be a scrollable feed of the most popular tokens, sorted by like count DESC.

The mint is always 500M tokens, and the user will be able to auction off tokens from the liquidity pool wallet to raise capital for launching on Raydium, or airdrop them as they see fit.

The auction will use $USDC on Solana blockchain so it is clear how much each token is priced at.

Arweave $AR will be used to store and host the logo. The user will pay for that transaction fee as well, which should also be minimal.

Starting a liquidity pool on Raydium is easy, but you probably want about $2,000 worth of capital to have a smooth launch.

Everything you need to start a cryptocurrency, and all you have to pay is the transaction fees, which are minimal on Solana.
