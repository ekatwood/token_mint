# token-mint.io

Solana blockchain allows users to interact with their blockchain using JavaScript. They have made it very easy to make a crytpocurrency token, and all you have to pay is the transaction fees.

token-mint.io is a website that integrates Phantom Wallet browser extension to interact with the Solana blockchain.

You can customize your token; you upload the name, symbol, logo image, and optionally a description, as well as decide how many total tokens to mint in the supply (between 10 million and 2 billion tokens).

The website keeps 2% of the token supply minted, and it is automatically staked to Solana blockchain.

A big worry for users in the blockchain space is a 'rug pull' event. That happens when the people in charge or the project reserve too much of the token supply for people early in the project. The token goes live, and they sell a huge amount of tokens, causing the price to dip down considerably.

token-mint.io only keeps 2% of tokens as a fee, which would not really affect the price if they were sold.

However, the tokens are also staked, and if you are wise to investing, the longer you hold a token that is popular, the better it usually works out for you in the end.

So token-mint.io has a vested interest in the success of your token, and the tokens stored in the token-mint treasury vault.

Another interesting aspect of the token-mint treasury vault is that users can opt-in to random airdrops from the vault, that will be carefully selected.

And since the tokens are staked, the airdrops can be the staking rewards, creating a sustainable flow of intersting airdrops for the user.

There will be support for users to have an auction for any percentage % of their token supply, in either SOL, RAY, or USDC.

You need about $5k - $15k capital to start a stable liquidity pool on Raydium Protocol. The idea here is that users can try to auction off some tokens to raise capital to start a liquidity pool, and make their new token tradable to the public, again with any percentage % of the token supply they want.

token-mint.io strives to be a 1-stop-shop for making a brand new, fully customized Solana blockchain token, and all the user has to pay in terms of money is the Solana transaction fees.

Also, there will be a 'like' button next to your cryptocurrency, as well as a main page displaying the most liked cryptocurrency tokens, sortable by Hour, Day, Week, Month, 6 Months.

This project is still being built, there is about 2 more months of development work to do, and then it needs 2 weeks of testing, and marketing to launch the website once it is through test.

Here are some screenshots of the front end token factory page:
