# token_mint

Mint your own Solana Program Library (SPL) token, for the cost of a few Solana and Arweave blockchain transactions.

Pick the name, symbol and logo image for your cryptocurrency.

Pay the transaction fees in SOL, and the website also keeps a fee of 2% of tokens. And you just might randomly get an airdrop once in a while from the treasury vault.

We hope you make a winner!

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user's public wallet address, showcasing the tokens they've created, with a 'like' button for each token.

The main page of the website will be a scrollable feed of the most popular tokens, sorted by most liked, filterable by Day, Week, Month, 6 Months, All Time.

You can even decide on how many tokens to mint, anywhere between 10 million and 2 billion tokens.

Arweave will be used to store and host the logo image (recommended 500x500px png, jpg, jpeg, or webp). You will also need to store a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that points to the image uri.

Project is built to be used with Google Chrome browser, and Phantom Wallet browser extension.

To receive 50% equity in the website and receive 1% of tokens from minting (invest in the website), be the first person to send 100 SOL to: EAnhd395fYm16SgYvEGVhp1hhukVGb5oz7CwK6nBf4Mw

If more than one person sends, I will send back to whoever wasn't first. But you can look it up here: https://explorer.solana.com/address/EAnhd395fYm16SgYvEGVhp1hhukVGb5oz7CwK6nBf4Mw
