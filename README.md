# MOONROCKET

Mint customizable Solana tokens for just the price of the transaction fees (a few transactions on Solana and Arweave, both payable with SOL). The transaction fees should be <$5 and probably around $1.

3% of tokens are sent to the MOONROCKET treasury vault as a fee and staked for 6 months.

97% of tokens are sent to your Solflare wallet.
