# token_mint

A Solana token factory with no fees, just the transaction fees.

Here's the breakdown:

95% of tokens  -> liquidity pool wallet

4.5% of tokens -> user of website

0.5% of tokens -> goes to the website

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user, showcasing the logo art and name of the new token.

Arweave $AR will be used to store and host the logo. The user will pay for that transaction fee as well, which should also be minimal.

The user will be able to set a price for each token and auction off some of the premine, or they can just airdrop tokens as they see fit.

Starting a liquidity pool on Raydium is easy, but you probably want about $5k worth of capital to have a smooth launch.

Everything you need to start a cryptocurrency, and all you have to pay is the transaction fees, which are minimal on Solana.
