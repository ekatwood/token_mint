# token_mint

500M tokens minted, with just a few clicks and a few transactions using Solana $SOL.

Here's the breakdown:

95% of tokens  -> liquidity pool wallet

4.5% of tokens -> user of website

0.5% of tokens -> goes to the website

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user's public wallet address, showcasing the tokens they've created, with a 'like' button for each.

The main page will be a scrollable feed of the most popular tokens, sorted by like count DESC.

The mint is always 500M tokens, and the user will be able to auction off tokens from the liquidity pool wallet to raise capital for launching on Raydium, or airdrop them as they see fit.

The auction will use $USDC on Solana blockchain so it is clear how much each token is priced at.

Arweave $AR will be used to store and host the logo image (recommended 500x500 px .png, .jpg, or .svg) and JSON required for the token's metadata so the logo image can be displayed on Raydium Protocol.

Starting a liquidity pool on Raydium is easy, but you probably want about $500 worth of capital to launch it.

Everything you need to start a cryptocurrency, and all you have to pay is the transaction fees.

There is a total of 0.25% of tokens (50% equity, since the website keeps 0.5% of tokens) available for a total of 25 $SOL. You can send any amount of $SOL to the following address, to get a portion of that equity, until 25 $SOL is achieved. Please only send amounts in increments of 0.5 $SOL.

Your minted Solana SPL tokens will be distributed to the public wallet address you send the $SOL with. This project will remain open source, so you can see your public wallet address in the source code when the website goes to production, and verify the amount being sent to you.
