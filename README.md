# token_mint

Mint your own Solana Program Library (SPL) token, for the cost of a few Solana and Arweave blockchain transactions.

Here is the breakdown:

99.9% of tokens  -> your wallet

0.1% of tokens -> goes to the token-mint treasury wallet

We hope you make a winner!

A unique, shareable webpage will be created for the user's public wallet address, showcasing the tokens they've created, with a 'like' button for each token.

The main page of the website will be a scrollable feed of the most popular tokens, sorted by most liked, filterable by Day, Week, Month, 6 Months, All Time.

You can even decide on how many tokens to mint, anywhere between 10 million and 2 billion tokens.

Arweave will be used to store and host the logo image (recommended 500x500px png, jpg, jpeg, or webp). You will also need to store a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that points to the image uri. This is the metadata that websites use to display your token logo image. Transaction fees can be paid using Solana blockchain.

Project is built to be used with Google Chrome browser, and Phantom Wallet browser extension.

To receive 50% equity in the website and receive 0.05% of tokens from minting (invest in the website), be the first person to send 250 SOL to: EAnhd395fYm16SgYvEGVhp1hhukVGb5oz7CwK6nBf4Mw

If more than one person sends, I will send back to whoever wasn't first. But you can look it up here: https://explorer.solana.com/address/EAnhd395fYm16SgYvEGVhp1hhukVGb5oz7CwK6nBf4Mw
